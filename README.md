# AgriTech---USGS-LIDAR


> At AgriTech, we are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on farms.

## Description
> **LiDAR** (light detection and ranging) is a popular remote sensing mechanism used for measuring the exact distance of an object on the earth's surface. Since the introduction of GPS technology, it has become a widely used method for calculating accurate geospatial measurements. These geospatial data are used for different analysis purposes.

> The purpose of this project is to build models of water flow and predict maize harvest if we better understand how water flows through a field, and which parts are likely to be flooded or too dry.
